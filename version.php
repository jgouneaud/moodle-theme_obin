 * association (French non-profit, loi 1901), committed to digital inclusion.
 * This theme adds no new features: it applies the association's official
 * graphic charter (colours, typography) on top of Boost, without modifying
 * its layouts.

// Compatibility actually verified (dedicated test installs, theme activated,
// dashboard + admin + front page checked without error): Moodle 4.3, 4.5
// and 5.2 — no code changes were needed across these three versions.
// Intermediate versions (4.4, 5.0, 5.1) were not tested but are likely
// compatible; no breaking changes observed over the covered range.
// Notable for Moodle 5.x: the "public/" directory split (see Moodle's
// UPGRADING.md) only affects web-server configuration, not the theme code
// itself — theme_obin requires no modification for that.
